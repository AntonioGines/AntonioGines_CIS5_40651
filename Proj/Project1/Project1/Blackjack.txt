Welcome to Blackjack 21!
Here are the rules of the game. To start you must place a
bet of at least $15 and up to a maximum of $500. Afterwards,
you will be given two cards and the dealer will draw two cards for
himself. The objective of the game is to keep the total
value of the cards at or under 21 and to beat the dealer.
Once you have seen your cards you can choose to either stay, hit,
double down, or split. To stay means to keep your current
cards. To hit means to ask for another card. To double down is to"
double your initial bet but this can only be done after
recieving your first two cards meaning you cannot hit and then
double down. To split means to take two cards of matching
value (Examples:A 9 of Hearts and a 9 of Spades) and split them into
two separate decks and a singular card will be added to each deck.
On top of this your initial bet will also be doubled.
Beyond this it is relatively simple. You lose if the dealer
gets a higher total than you that does not exceed 21 and you win if
you have a higher total than the dealer that also does not
exceed 21. Also, if the dealer busts but you do not it is an
automatic win regardless of how small your numbers are.
Note: In the current state of the game, 1 and 11(which are the 
values of an Ace) are separate values. This will be fixed in the 
next version and I apologize if this negatively impacts your experience
with the game.
